# Configuration file description

The configuration file in OBD has a fixed format. The following example shows what each module in the configuration file means.

```shell
# Only need to configure when remote login is required
user:   # The SSH login configuration.
  username: your username
  password: your password if need
  key_file: your ssh-key file path if need
  port: your ssh port, default 22
  timeout: ssh connection timeout (second), default 30
oceanbase-ce:  # The name of the component that is configured as follows.
  # version: 3.1.0    # Specify the version of the component, which is usually not required. 
  # package_hash: 9decc4788a7fc6cc2082ac1668f287f60f4a3b8d05a58da094605aa2f19d18fc  # Specify the hash of the component, which is usually not required. 
  # tag: dev    # Specify the tag of the component, which is usually not required. 
  servers:  # The list of nodes.
    - name: z1  # The node name,  which can be left blank. The default node name is the same as the IP address if this name is left blank. The node name is z1 in this example.
      # Please don't use hostname, only IP can be supported
      ip: 192.168.1.2
    - name: z2
      ip: 192.168.1.3
    - name: z3
      ip: 192.168.1.4
  global:  # The global configuration. The identical configuration in the same component can be written here.
           # The node configuration is used if it has the same configuration item as the global configuration.
    # Please set devname as the network adaptor's name whose ip is in the setting of severs.
    # if set severs as "127.0.0.1", please set devname as "lo"
    # if current ip is 192.168.1.10, and the ip's network adaptor's name is "eth0", please use "eth0"
    devname: eth0
    # if current hardware's memory capacity is smaller than 50G, please use the setting of "mini-single-example.yaml" and do a small adjustment.
