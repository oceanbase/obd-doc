# Deploy OCP through the GUI

This topic uses the creation of a new OceanBase cluster as an example to demonstrate how to deploy OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) using the OBD graphic user interface (GUI).

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>Currently, OBD only supports OCP Community Edition V4.2.1 and later versions. </p>
</main>

## Terms

* OceanBase Database

   A fully self-developed enterprise-grade native distributed database. For more information, see [OceanBase Database Documentation](https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/oceanbase-database).

* OBD

   OceanBase Deployer, an installation and deployment tool for OceanBase Database. For more information, see [OBD Documentation](../../100.what-is-obd.md).

* ODP

   OceanBase Database Proxy (also known as OBProxy), a dedicated proxy server for OceanBase Database. For more information, see [ODP Documentation](https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/odp-en).

* OCP

   OceanBase Cloud Platform. For more information, see [OCP Documentation](https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/ocp-en).

* MetaDB

   An important component of OCP. MetaDB provides underlying storage capabilities for managing metadata and monitoring data in OCP. OCP-Server provides full lifecycle management services for OceanBase Database by calling the data stored in MetaDB.

## Prerequisites

* You have installed OBD V2.4.0 or later versions. For information about how to upgrade OBD, see **How do I upgrade OBD?** in [FAQ](../../500.faq/100.faq.md).

* You have installed and configured a Java environment on the server where you want to deploy OCP, and the Java version is 1.8.0 with a minimum build version of 161. For information about how to configure a Java environment, see **How do I configure the Java environment before I deploy OCP Express?** in [FAQ](../../500.faq/100.faq.md).

  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>This topic assumes that the server being used can connect to the Internet or has already been configured with the necessary software (OceanBase Database, OBAgent, OBProxy, OCP, etc.). For detailed instructions on how to configure the required software, see the <b>Configure OBD</b> section in the <a href="../../200.quick-start/100.install-obd.md">Install and configure OBD</a> topic. </p>
</main>

## Procedure

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>The following describes the procedure for deploying OCP on a CentOS Linux 7.9 system based on the x86 architecture using the OBD GUI, with OBD V2.4.0 as an example. Please note that the GUI may differ depending on the version of OBD being used. </p>
</main>

## Step 1: Start the GUI

1. Run the `obd web install` command to start the OBD GUI, and click the returned IP address to access the GUI.

   ```shell
   [admin@test001 ~]$ obd web install
   start OBD WEB in 0.0.0.0:8680
   please open http://10.10.10.1:8680
   ```

   <main id="notice" type='explain'>
     <h4>Note</h4>
     <ul>
     <li>
     <p>The default port in the IP address is 8680. You can use the <code>obd web -p &lt;PORT></code> command to specify a port. </p>
     </li>
     <li>
     <p>In Alibaba Cloud or other cloud environments, the program may fail to obtain a public IP address but return an intranet IP address. You must use a correct public IP address to access the GUI. </p>
     </li>
     <li>
     <p>The <code>obd web</code> command is bound to the IP address <code>0.0.0.0</code>. In a multi-network card deployment, you can access the GUI using any accessible IP address. </p>
     </li>
     </ul>
   </main>

3. Click **Next Step** in the lower right part of the page.

## Step 5: Perform a pre-check

This step corresponds to the **Pre-Check** phase in the deployment progress tracker dashboard.

1. In the **Pre-Check** section, you can view all the configuration information.

   * If there are any issues, you can click **Previous step** to address them.

   * If there are no issues, click **Pre-Check** to initiate the pre-check process. Then, the system will verify whether your environment meets the requirements for installing and configuring MetaDB and OCP.

     If any errors are reported during the pre-check, you have two options. You can click **Automatic Repair** to automatically fix the issues for items that can be automatically repaired. Alternatively, you can click **Learn more** next to each error to access the error code documentation. The documentation will guide you on making the necessary modifications based on the provided references. After making all the required modifications, you can perform the pre-check again by clicking **Re-check**.

   ![Precheck](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/obd/V2.4.0/en-US/200.quick-start/3.deploy-ocp-by-ui-09.png)

2. After the pre-check is successful, click **Next Step** in the lower right part of the page.

## Step 6: Deploy OCP

This step corresponds to the **Deployment** phase in the deployment progress tracker dashboard.

During the deployment process, the deployment logs will be displayed in the **Deployment log** section on the page.

* If the deployment fails, view the log information to identify the cause of the failure. Contact OceanBase Technical Support for assistance or submit a question in the [Q&A](https://ask.oceanbase.com/) section on the OceanBase official website. Professional personnel will be available to help resolve the issue. Once you have identified and fixed the cause of the installation failure, click **Re-deploy**. In the confirmation window that appears, click **OK**. The system will clean up the current failed OCP installation environment and restart the installation process.

* If the deployment is successful, you can click **Copy information** to save the OCP access address and account information. After copying and saving this information, click **Finish** to exit the deployment program.

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>After a successful deployment, you can check whether OCP is working properly by referring to <a href="https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/community-ocp-en-10000000000840064">Check after deployment or update</a> in the OCP documentation. </p>
