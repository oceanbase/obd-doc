# Deploy OCP Express by using commands

This topic describes how to use commands to deploy OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) Express in three different scenarios.

<main id="notice" type='notice'>
  <h4>Notice</h4>
  <p>Each OBServer node in the cluster must have a corresponding OceanBase Agent (OBAgent). Otherwise, OCP Express cannot run properly. </p>
</main>

## Prerequisites

* The version of OceanBase Database is V4.0.0.0 or later.

* The version of OBAgent is V1.3.0 or later. If the version of OCP Express is V4.2.1 or later, that of OBAgent must be V4.2.1 or later.

* The version of OceanBase Deployer (OBD) is V2.0.0 or later. If the version of OCP Express is V4.2.1 or later, that of OBD must be V2.3.1 or later. If the OBD you are using is earlier than V2.0.0, upgrade the OBD by referring to **How to update OBD?** in [FAQ](../../500.faq/100.faq.md).

* The Java environment is installed and configured on the server where you want to deploy OCP Express. Only Java Development Kit (JDK) 1.8 is supported. For more information, see **How do I configure the Java environment before I deploy OCP Express?** in [FAQ](../../500.faq/100.faq.md).

* It is recommended to allocate at least 512 MB of memory for OCP Express. For long-term stable operation, it is recommended to allocate 762 MB or more.

  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>Assume that the servers mentioned in this topic can connect to the Internet or are configured with required software such as OceanBase Database, OBAgent, OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP), and OCP Express. For more information about how to configure required software, see <b>Configure OBD</b> in <a href="../../200.quick-start/100.install-obd.md">Install and configure OBD</a>. </p>
</main>

## Resource specifications of OCP Express

### Configuration requirements

The OCP Express service generates high computing and storage overheads during running. Therefore, you must perform resource planning based on the specifications of managed objects. The following table lists the resource consumption of the OCP Express server based on the assumption that each cluster contains 10 tenants. You can calculate the resource consumption and properly configure resources based on the actual situation.

| Number of servers to be managed | CPU (core) | Memory (GB) | Disk (GB) |
|-------------------|---------|-----------|----------|
| ≤ 10 | 1 | 2 | 20 |
| ≤ 20 | 2 | 4 | 20 |
| ≤ 50 | 4 | 8 | 20 |

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>Configure resources for the OCP Express server based on the preceding overhead data and other resource consumption information of the system. To ensure system stability, we recommend that you configure at least 4 CPU cores and 8 GB of memory for the OCP Express server. When a single host contains 10 tenants or less, the 4C8GB configuration is still recommended. </p>
</main>

### MetaDB resources

Meta Database (MetaDB) stores the metadata and monitoring data of OCP Express. We recommend that you create an independent tenant in the OceanBase cluster for MetaDB.

The resources required vary with the number of OBServer nodes managed in OCP Express. The following table lists the CPU, memory, and disk resources for each replica in a tenant for MetaDB based on the assumption that each cluster contains 10 tenants. You can calculate the resource consumption and properly configure resources based on the actual situation.

| Number of servers to be managed | CPU (core) | Memory (GB) | Disk (GB) |
|-------------------|---------|-----------|----------|
| ≤ 10 | 1 | 4 | 50 |
| ≤ 20 | 2 | 8 | 100 |
| ≤ 50 | 4 | 16 | 200  |

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>The resource consumption provided here is a ballpark figure. The actual resource consumption of MetaDB varies with the business volume. </p>
</main>

## Configuration files

OBD provides sample configuration files for deploying OCP Express. You can modify them based on your server resources.

* If OBD is directly downloaded and installed on your server, you can view the sample configuration file provided by OBD in the `/usr/obd/example` directory.

* If OBD is installed by using the all-in-one package, you can view the sample configuration file provided by OBD in the `~/.oceanbase-all-in-one/obd/usr/obd/example` directory.

* You can also view the sample configuration files provided by OBD at [GitHub](https://github.com/oceanbase/obdeploy/tree/master/example).

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>Two types of configuration files are available: one for the small-scale development mode and one for the professional development mode. The configuration files for the two modes contain the same parameters but different parameter values. You can select a file based on your resource conditions. </p>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <p>The small-scale development mode applies to individual devices with at least 8 GB of memory. The configuration file name contains <code>mini</code> or <code>min</code>. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>The professional development mode applies to advanced Elastic Compute Service (ECS) instances or physical servers with at least 16 CPU cores and 64 GB of memory. </p>
  </li>
  </ul>
</main>

OBD provides the following sample configuration files for deploying OCP Express:

* Sample configuration files for distributed deployment with all components: `all-components-min.yaml` and `all-components.yaml`

* Sample configuration files for distributed deployment with ODP and OCP Express: `default-components.yaml` and `default-components-min.yaml`

* Sample configuration file for deploying OCP Express only: `ocp-express-only.yaml`

## Scenario 1: Deploy an OceanBase cluster and OCP Express together

If you want to deploy an OceanBase cluster and OCP Express at the same time, you must configure the tenant information required by OCP Express in the oceanbase-ce component. You can directly declare in the configuration file that the configurations of the ocp-express component depend on other components such as oceanbase-ce, obproxy-ce, and obagent. In this case, you only need to configure `home_path` and `memory_size`, and other parameters are obtained from the dependent components.

The following example describes parameters of the oceanbase-ce component in the `default-components.yaml` configuration file:

```yaml
oceanbase-ce:
  servers:
    - name: server1
      ip: 172.xx.xxx.4
  global:
    home_path: xxxx
    ...
    ocp_meta_tenant:
      tenant_name: ocp_meta
      max_cpu: 2
      memory_size: 6442450944
    ocp_meta_db: ocp_express
    ocp_meta_username: ocp_user
    ocp_meta_password:
    ...
```

| Parameter | Required? | Default value | Description |
|--------------------|----------|-------|-------------------------------|
| ocp_meta_tenant->tenant_name | No | ocp | The name of the meta tenant created for OCP Express.  |
| ocp_meta_tenant->max_cpu | No | 1 | The maximum number of CPU cores allocated to the meta tenant.  |
| ocp_meta_tenant->memory_size | No | 2147483648 | The memory allocated to the meta tenant.  |
| ocp_meta_db | No | ocp_express | The database that stores data for OCP Express.  |
| ocp_meta_username | No | meta | The name of an OCP Express user in the meta tenant.  |
| ocp_meta_password | No | oceanbase | The password of the user. If you do not specify this parameter, OBD automatically generates a random password. After the deployment is completed, you can run the `obd cluster edit-config` command to query the password from the configuration file.  |

The parameters beginning with `ocp_meta_tenant` are passed when the tenant is created. The preceding table shows only a few important parameters. For specific parameters, see the parameters supported in the tenant creation command. For more information, see the description of the `obd cluster tenant create` command in [Cluster commands](../../300.obd-command/100.cluster-command-groups.md).

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>If the preceding parameters are not specified, OBD will create a meta tenant for OCP Express based on the default resource specification. However, the number of tenants is unpredictable. Therefore, we recommend that you modify the resource specification of the meta tenant as needed based on the following formula:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <p>data_disk = 3.5 + Node quantity × 0.5 (unit: GB) </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>log_disk = 4.5 + Node quantity × 0.5 + Tenant quantity × 0.5 (unit: GB) </p>
  </li>
  </ul>
</main>

During the bootstrap of the oceanbase-ce component, if OBD detects that the preceding parameters are specified or the ocp-express component exists in the current cluster, OBD automatically creates the corresponding meta tenant and user.

Configurations of the ocp-express component are as follows:

```yaml
ocp-express:
  depends:
    - oceanbase-ce
    - obproxy-ce
    - obagent
  servers:
    - name: server2
      ip: 10.10.10.4
  global:
    # The working directory for ocp-express. ocp-express is started under this directory. This is a required field.
    home_path: /home/admin/ocp-server
    # log_dir: /home/admin/ocp-server/log # The log directory of ocp express server. The default value is {home_path}/log.
    memory_size: 1G # The memory size of ocp-express server. The recommend value is 512MB * (expect node num + expect tenant num) * 60MB.
    logging_file_total_size_cap: 10GB # The total log file size of ocp-express server.
```

The following table describes the parameters.

| Parameter | Required? | Default value | Description |
|--------------|----------|--------|------------------------------|
| home_path | Yes | None | The working directory of OCP Express. OCP Express boots from this directory.  |
| memory_size | Yes | None | The memory capacity of the OCP Express server. The recommended calculation formula is as follows: memory_size = 512 MB + (Expected number of nodes × Expected number of tenants) × 60 MB. </br>The expected number of tenants should include the `sys` tenant and the OCP meta tenant.  |
| logging_file_total_size_cap | Yes | 1 GB | The total size of log files. The default value is 1 GB. <blockquote>**Notice**: </br>The unit of this parameter must be GB or MB. If you use the unit G or M, an error will occur, and OCP Express deployment will not be successful. </blockquote> |

After you modify the configuration file, run the following commands to deploy and start the cluster:

```shell
# Deploy the cluster
obd cluster deploy <deploy name> -c config.yaml
# Start the cluster
obd cluster start <deploy name>
```

After the cluster is started, you can use the login address, username, and password of the `ocp-express` server provided in the command output to log in to OCP Express and start using it.

## Scenario 2: Add OCP Express to an OceanBase cluster (with OBAgent deployed)

If you have already deployed an OceanBase cluster and OBAgent, you can refer to this section.

1. (Optional) If the version of OBAgent in the cluster is earlier than V1.3.0, run the following command to upgrade OBAgent:

   ```shell
   # View the hash value of OBAgent
   obd mirror list oceanbase.community.stable | grep -e " obagent "
   # Upgrade OBAgent
   obd cluster upgrade test -c obagent -V 1.3.0 --usable=<obagent_hash>
   ```

   You must replace `obagent_hash` in the command with the hash value of OBAgent of the corresponding version.

2. Create a meta tenant, a user, and a database for OCP Express, and grant the user the required privileges.

   1. Create a meta tenant.

      ```shell
      obd cluster tenant create <deploy name> -n <tenant_name> --max-cpu=2 --memory-size=4G --log-disk-size=3G --max-iops=10000 --iops-weight=2 --unit-num=1 --charset=utf8
      ```

      The specifications of the meta tenant must be configured based on the deployed cluster resources. For more information, see [MetaDB resources](#MetaDB%20resources). For more information about the `obd cluster tenant create` command, see the description of the `obd cluster tenant create` commands in [Cluster commands](../../300.obd-command/100.cluster-command-groups.md).

      You can also log in to OceanBase Database to create a tenant for OCP Express. For more information, see [Create a tenant](https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/common-oceanbase-database-10000000001103995).

   2. Create a user and grant the user the required privileges.

      ```shell
      create user <ocp_user> identified by '<ocp_password>';
      grant all on *.* to <ocp_user>;
      ```

   3. Create a database.

      ```shell
      create database <database_name>;
      ```

3. Modify the configuration file.

   The following example describes parameters of the `ocp-express-only.yaml` configuration file:

   ```yaml
   ## Only need to configure when remote login is required
   # user:
   #   username: your username
   #   password: your password if need
   #   key_file: your ssh-key file path if need
   #   port: your ssh port, default 22
   #   timeout: ssh connection timeout (second), default 30
   ocp-express:
     servers:
       - name: server1
         ip: xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
     global:
       # The working directory for ocp-express. ocp-express is started under this directory. This is a required field.
       home_path: /home/admin/ocp-server
       log_dir: /home/admin/ocp-server/log # The log directory of ocp express server. The default value is {home_path}/log.
       memory_size: 1G # The memory size of ocp-express server. The recommend value is 512MB * (expect node num + expect tenant num) * 60MB.
       jdbc_url: jdbc:oceanbase://IP:PORT/meta_db # jdbc connection string to connect to the meta db
       jdbc_username: user_name@tenant_name # username to connect to meta db

       port: 8180 # The http port to use.
       cluster_name: obcluster # the cluster name of oceanbase cluster. Refer to the configuration item appname of oceanbase
       ob_cluster_id: 1 # the cluster id of oceanbase cluster. Refer to the configuration item cluster_id of oceanbase
       root_sys_password: <password for root@sys>
       agent_username: <obagent> # The username of obagent
       agent_password: <password> # The password of obagent
       logging_file_total_size_cap: 10GB # The total log file size of ocp-express server.
       server_addresses: # The cluster info for oceanbase cluster
       - address: 127.0.0.1 # The address of oceanbase server
         svrPort: 2882 # The rpc port of oceanbase server
         sqlPort: 2881 # The mysql port of oceanbase server
         agentMgrPort: 8089 # The port of obagent manager process

   | server_addresses->agentMonPort | Yes | The port for the monitoring process of OBAgent, which must be modified according to the actual setting in the OBAgent.  |

4. After you modify the configuration file, run the following commands to deploy and start the cluster:

   ```shell
   # Deploy the cluster
   obd cluster deploy <deploy name> -c config.yaml
   # Start the cluster
   obd cluster start <deploy name>
   ```

5. After the cluster is started, you can use the login address, username, and password of the `ocp-express` server provided in the command output to log in to OCP Express and start using it.

## Scenario 3: Add OCP Express to an OceanBase cluster (without deploying OBAgent)

If you have already deployed an OceanBase cluster but have not deployed OBAgent, you can refer to this section.

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>OCP Express strongly depends on OBAgent. If OBAgent is not deployed in the cluster, you must deploy both OBAgent and OCP Express. </p>
</main>

### Step 1: Create a meta tenant

Create a meta tenant, a user, and a database for OCP Express, and grant the user the required privileges.

1. Create a meta tenant.

   ```shell
   obd cluster tenant create <deploy name> -n <tenant_name> --max-cpu=2 --memory-size=4G --log-disk-size=3G --max-iops=10000 --iops-weight=2 --unit-num=1 --charset=utf8
   ```

   The specifications of the meta tenant must be configured according to the specific cluster deployment. For detailed information, see [MetaDB resources](#MetaDB%20resources). For detailed instructions on the `obd cluster tenant create` command, see the description of the `obd cluster tenant create` command in [Cluster commands](../../300.obd-command/100.cluster-command-groups.md).

   You can also log in to OceanBase Database to create a tenant for OCP Express. For detailed instructions, see [Create a tenant](https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/common-oceanbase-database-10000000001103995).

2. Create a user and grant the user the required privileges.

   ```shell
   create user <ocp_user> identified by '<ocp_password>';
   grant all on *.* to <ocp_user>;
   ```

3. Create a database.

   ```shell
   create database <database_name>;
   ```

### Step 2: Modify the configuration file

You can refer to this section to configure OBAgent and OCP Express.

1. Configure the user.

   ```yaml
   ## Only need to configure when remote login is required
   user:
     username: admin
   #   password: your password if need
     key_file: /home/admin/.ssh/id_rsa
   #   port: your ssh port, default 22
   #   timeout: ssh connection timeout (second), default 30
   ```

   Here, `username` specifies the username for logging in to the target server. Make sure that your username has the write privilege on `home_path`. Generally, you can specify either `password` or `key_file` because both of them are used for user authentication.

<main id="notice" type='notice'>
     <h4>Notice</h4>
     <p>After you specify the path of the key, comment out or delete the <code>password</code> field if your key does not require a password. Otherwise, the value of the <code>password</code> parameter will be considered as the password of the key during login, which may result in a login verification failure. </p>
   </main>

2. Configure OBAgent.

   ```yaml
   obagent:
     servers:
       # Do not use the hostname. Only IP address is supported.
       - 10.10.10.1
       - 10.10.10.2
       - 10.10.10.3
     global:

       mgragent_log_max_days: 30
       # The maximum number for manager agent log files. The default value is 15.
       mgragent_log_max_backups: 15
       # The log level of monitor agent.
       monagent_log_level: info
       # The total size of monitor agent.Log size is measured in Megabytes. The default value is 200M.
       monagent_log_max_size: 200
       # Expiration time for monitor agent logs. The default value is 30 days.
       monagent_log_max_days: 30
       # The maximum number for monitor agent log files. The default value is 15.
       monagent_log_max_backups: 15
       # The username for HTTP authentication. The default value is admin.
       http_basic_auth_user: admin
       # Password for HTTP authentication.
       http_basic_auth_password: ******
       # Monitor password for OceanBase Database. The default value is empty. When a depends exists, OBD gets this value from the oceanbase-ce of the depends. The value is the same as the ocp_agent_monitor_password in oceanbase-ce.

       cluster_name: obcluster
       # Cluster ID for OceanBase Database. When a depends exists, OBD gets this value from the oceanbase-ce of the depends. The value is the same as the cluster_id in oceanbase-ce.
       cluster_id: 1
       # The redo dir for Oceanbase Database. When a depends exists, OBD gets this value from the oceanbase-ce of the depends. The value is the same as the redo_dir in oceanbase-ce.
       ob_log_path: /home/admin/observer/store
       # The data dir for Oceanbase Database. When a depends exists, OBD gets this value from the oceanbase-ce of the depends. The value is the same as the data_dir in oceanbase-ce.
       ob_data_path: /home/admin/observer/store
       # The work directory for Oceanbase Database. When a depends exists, OBD gets this value from the oceanbase-ce of the depends. The value is the same as the home_path in oceanbase-ce.
       ob_install_path: /home/admin/observer
       # The log path for Oceanbase Database. When a depends exists, OBD gets this value from the oceanbase-ce of the depends. The value is the same as the {home_path}/log in oceanbase-ce.
       observer_log_path: /home/admin/observer/log
       # Monitor status for OceanBase Database. Active is to enable. Inactive is to disable. The default value is active. When you deploy a cluster automatically, OBD decides whether to enable this parameter based on depends.
       ob_monitor_status: active
     10.10.10.1:
       # Zone name for your observer. The default value is zone1. When a depends exists, OBD gets this value from the oceanbase-ce of the depends. The value is the same as the zone name in oceanbase-ce.

   ```

   | Parameter | Required? | Default value | Description |
   |----------|-----------|----------|----------|
   | servers | Yes | None | You must specify each server with `- name: server ID (line break) ip: server IP address`. The server ID must be unique. </br>If the server IP addresses are unique, you can also use the `- <ip> (line break)- <ip>` format to specify them. In this case, `- <ip>` is equivalent to `- name: server IP address (line break) ip: server IP address`.  |
   | home_path | Yes | None | The working directory of the component. We recommend that you create this directory under the common user `admin`.  |

3. Configure OCP Express.

   ```yaml
   ocp-express:
     depends:
       - obagent
     servers:
       - name: server1
         ip: 10.10.10.4
     global:
       # The working directory for ocp-express. ocp-express is started under this directory. This is a required field.
       home_path: /home/admin/ocp-server
       log_dir: /home/admin/ocp-server/log # The log directory of ocp express server. The default value is {home_path}/log.
       memory_size: 1G # The memory size of ocp-express server. The recommend value is 512MB * (expect node num + expect tenant num) * 60MB.
       jdbc_url: jdbc:oceanbase://IP:PORT/meta_db # jdbc connection string to connect to the meta db
       jdbc_username: user_name@tenant_name # username to connect to meta db
       jdbc_password: '<meta db password>' # password to connect to meta db
       port: 8180 # The http port to use.
       cluster_name: obcluster # the cluster name of oceanbase cluster. Refer to the configuration item appname of oceanbase
       ob_cluster_id: 1 # the cluster id of oceanbase cluster. Refer to the configuration item cluster_id of oceanbase

   ```

   | Parameter | Required? | Description |
   |--------------------|----------|--------------------------------------|
   | home_path | Yes | The working directory of OCP Express. OCP Express boots from this directory.  |
   | log_dir | No | The log directory of OCP Express. The default value is the log directory in the path specified by the `home_path` parameter.  |
   | memory_size | Yes | The memory capacity of the OCP Express server. The recommended calculation formula is as follows: memory_size = 512 MB + (Expected number of nodes × Expected number of tenants) × 60 MB. </br>The expected number of tenants should include the `sys` tenant and the OCP meta tenant.  |
   | jdbc_url | Yes | The JDBC connection string for connecting to the meta tenant. Make sure that the database used in the connection string has been created.  |
   | jdbc_username | Yes | The username for connecting to the meta tenant. Make sure that this user has been created. <blockquote> **Note** </br>The username format here is `user_name@tenant_name`. If `user_name` is specified and `tenant_name` is omitted, `user_name@sys` will be used for the connection by default. The `sys` tenant cannot be used as a meta tenant. </blockquote> |
   | jdbc_password | Yes | The user password for connecting to the meta tenant.  |
   | port | No | The HTTP port for accessing OCP Express.  |
   | cluster_name | Yes | The name of the OceanBase cluster, which must be the same as the value of the `appname` parameter in the oceanbase-ce component.  |
   | ob_cluster_id | Yes | The ID of the OceanBase cluster, which must be the same as the value of the `cluster_id` parameter in the oceanbase-ce component.  |
   | root_sys_password | Yes | The password of the `root@sys` user in the OceanBase cluster.  |
   | logging_file_total_size_cap | Yes | The total size of log files. The default value is 1 GB. <blockquote>**Notice**: </br>The unit of this parameter must be GB or MB. If you use the unit G or M, an error will occur, and OCP Express deployment will not be successful. </blockquote> |
   | server_addresses->address | Yes | The IP address of the OBServer node.  |
   | server_addresses->svrPort | Yes | The RPC port of the OBServer node, which must be the same as the value of the `rpc_port` parameter of the corresponding node in the oceanbase-ce component.  |
   | server_addresses->sqlPort | Yes | The MySQL port of the OBServer node, which must be the same as the value of the `mysql_port` parameter of the corresponding node in the oceanbase-ce component.  |

### Step 3: Deploy OCP Express

After you modify the configuration file, run the following commands to deploy and start OCP Express:

```shell
# Deploy the cluster
obd cluster deploy <deploy name> -c config.yaml
# Start the cluster
obd cluster start <deploy name>
```

After the cluster is started, you can use the login address, username, and password of the `ocp-express` server provided in the command output to log in to OCP Express and start using it.
