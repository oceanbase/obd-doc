# Take over a cluster

You can take over a cluster that is created on a command-line client or another OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) system, and maintain and manage the cluster through the current OCP system.

## Prerequisite

The logon user who takes over the cluster has the CLUSTER_MANAGER role, or the permission to create a cluster.

## Procedure

1. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Clusters**. The Cluster Overview page appears.

2. Click **Take over Cluster** in the upper-right corner.

3. Connect to the cluster. The following two connection modes are supported: :

   1. Direct Connection: Specify **URL**, **Port**, and **Root@sys Password**, and click **Next**.

    ![Direct-Connection]()

   2. **OBProxy**: Specify **URL**, **Port**, **Cluster Name**, **Cluster ID (Optional)**, and **Root@sys Password**, and click **Next**.

   > **Note**
   >
   > When you are taking over a standby cluster, you must specify the cluster ID. If you need to take over both the primary and standby clusters, take over the primary cluster first.

   ![OBProxy]()

4. After the cluster is connected, perform pre-takeover check.
   1. When the check succeeds, select the host, type, and credentials, and click **Import** in the lower-right corner of the page.
   2. If the check fails, move the pointer over the icon next to Failed, modify the OBServer configuration as prompted, and then click **Recheck**.
