# Deploy an OceanBase cluster on the GUI

This topic describes how to use OceanBase Deployer (OBD) to deploy OceanBase Database in an x86-based CentOS Linux 7.9 system on the GUI.

## Background

OBD V2.0.0 or later supports GUI-based deployment for OceanBase Database and related components such as OceanBase Agent (OBAgent), OceanBase Database Proxy (OBD), and OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) Express. You can easily deploy an OceanBase cluster by following the wizard.

## Prerequisites

* At least 2 vCPUs, 8 GB of memory, and 45 GB of disk space are available for deploying OceanBase Database only.

* At least 4 vCPUs, 10 GB of memory, and 50 GB of disk space are available for deploying OceanBase Database and all its components. We recommend that more than 16 GB of memory be available.

* The Java environment has been installed and configured if OCP Express is to be deployed. At present, only Java Development Kit (JDK) 1.8 is supported. For more information, see the **How do I configure the Java environment before I deploy OCP Express?** section in [FAQ](../5.faq/1.faq.md).

    <h4>Notice</h4>
    <p>OBD remotely performs installation and deployment by using the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol. Therefore, you must use SSH to verify whether the Java environment is available. For more information, see <b>Verify the Java environment</b>.</p>
  </main>

## Prepare the software

You can use OBD to deploy OceanBase Database on the GUI in online or offline mode.

* Online deployment: Make sure that the server where OBD resides can connect to the Internet. In this deployment mode, OBD obtains the installation package from a remote image repository during deployment, without the need for you to deploy and configure the installation package in advance.

* Offline deployment: The server where OBD resides does not need to connect to the Internet during deployment. In this deployment mode, you must upload the installation package to the local image repository of OBD in advance. If you choose offline deployment, we recommend that you download the all-in-one package of the desired version.

Prepare the software based on the deployment mode.

### Online deployment

If you choose online deployment, run the following commands to install OBD on the central control server.

```shell
[admin@test001 ~]$ sudo yum install -y yum-utils
[admin@test001 ~]$ sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://mirrors.aliyun.com/oceanbase/OceanBase.repo
[admin@test001 ~]$ sudo yum install -y ob-deploy
[admin@test001 ~]$ source /etc/profile.d/obd.sh
```

### Offline deployment

If you choose offline deployment, run the following commands to download and install the all-in-one package.

You can download the latest all-in-one package from [OceanBase Download Center](https://www.oceanbase.com/softwarecenter) and copy the package to the central control server. Run the following commands to decompress and install the package:

```shell
[admin@test001 ~]$ tar -xzf oceanbase-all-in-one-*.tar.gz
[admin@test001 ~]$ cd oceanbase-all-in-one/bin/
[admin@test001 bin]$ ./install.sh
[admin@test001 bin]$ source ~/.oceanbase-all-in-one/bin/env.sh
```

## Procedure

1. Go to the GUI.

   Run the `obd web` command on the CLI, and click the generated URL to go to the GUI. On the GUI, click **Experience Now** to go to the OceanBase Database configuration page.

   ```shell

## Related operations

### Verify the Java environment

OBD remotely executes a script to deploy OCP Express. Therefore, you must use SSH to verify the Java environment. You cannot directly run the `java -version` command on the server where OCP Express is deployed to verify the Java environment.

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>Interactions between the client and server will initialize the environment variables, but the SSH access mode does not initialize environment variables. As a result, the system prompts that the Java command does not exist or the Java version is wrong when you use SSH.</p>
</main>

You can run the following command on any server that has established a network connection with the node where OCP Express resides.

```shell
# ocp_express_node_username: the username of the node where OCP Express resides
# ocp_express_node_ip: the IP address of the node where OCP Express resides
[admin@test001 ~]$ ssh <ocp_express_node_username>@<ocp_express_node_ip> 'java -version'

# Command output
openjdk version "1.8.0_xxx" 
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_362-b08)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.362-b08, mixed mode)
```

If the required Java environment has been installed but failed the verification, you can resolve the issue in the following ways:

* Method 1: Specify the **java_bin** parameter in the **More Configurations** section.

   As shown in the following figure, set `java_bin` to the real path of Java, such as `/jdk8/bin/java`.

   <img width="808.8" height="540.6" src="https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/obd/V2.1.0/en-US/2.quick-start/3.use-ui-deploy-oceanbase-07.png" alt="More Settings">

* Method 2: Create a soft link from the executable file of Java to `/usr/bin/java`.

   ```shell
   [admin@test001 bin]$ pwd
   /jdk8/bin
   [admin@test001 bin]$ ln -s /jdk8/bin/java  /usr/bin/java
   ```

### Manage the cluster

You can run the following commands to manage a cluster deployed by using OBD. For more information, see [Cluster commands](../3.obd-command/1.cluster-command-groups.md).

```shell
# View the cluster list.
[admin@test001 ~]$ obd cluster list

# View the status of the myoceanbase cluster.
[admin@test001 ~]$ obd cluster display myoceanbase

# Stop the myoceanbase cluster in the running state.
[admin@test001 ~]$ obd cluster stop myoceanbase

# Destroy the myoceanbase cluster.
[admin@test001 ~]$ obd cluster destroy myoceanbase
```

### Deploy a component of the desired version

The all-in-one package is iterated based on OceanBase Database versions. If any component in the package has a later version, you can download the component of the latest version from [OceanBase Download Center](https://www.oceanbase.com/softwarecenter) and then upload it to the local image repository of OBD. OBD will automatically obtain the latest version from the local image repository during deployment.

1. Go to the directory where the component installation package is located, run the following command to add it to the local image repository.

   ```shell
   [admin@test001 rpm]$ obd mirror clone *.rpm
   ```

2. View the list of installation packages in the local image repository.

   ```shell
   [admin@test001 rpm]$ obd mirror list local
   ```
