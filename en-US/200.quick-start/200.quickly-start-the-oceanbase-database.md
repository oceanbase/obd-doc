# Start an OceanBase cluster

After you deploy OceanBase Deployer (OBD), you can run the `obd demo` command to deploy and start OceanBase Database on a single local server. Make sure the following prerequisites are met:

- Ports `2881` and `2882` are not occupied.

- At least 6 GB of memory is available on the server.

- At least two CPU cores are available on the server.

- At least 54 GB of disk space is available on the server.

- Your server can be connected to the network, or there are installation packages required for deployment.
