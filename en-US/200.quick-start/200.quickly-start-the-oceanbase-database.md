# Quickly start OceanBase Database

After you install and configure OceanBase Deployer (OBD), you can run the `obd demo` command to quickly start a single-node OceanBase database on a local server. Before that, you need to ensure the following prerequisites are met:

* Ports `2881` and `2882` are not occupied.

* At least 6 GB of memory is available on the server.

* At least two CPU cores are available on the server.

* When deploying only the OceanBase database, at least 19 GB of disk space is available on the server; when deploying all components, at least 25 GB of disk space is available on the server.

* The server can access the Internet, or the required installation package is deployed on the server.
