# Version rules

This topic describes the version rules of OceanBase Deployer (OBD).

OBD will release new versions periodically. Different versions of OBD may have significant differences in functionality and features. Therefore, it is important for you to identify the version number of OBD you need in order to access accurate documentation information.

The versions of OBD are defined in the `V.x.y.z` format.

* `x` indicates a major version, which generally involves an architectural upgrade or a release of major features.

* `y` indicates a planned iteration version, which involves an update or optimization of major features in a normal iteration plan.

* `z` indicates an updated version, which involves a few updates in features and fixes known issues.
