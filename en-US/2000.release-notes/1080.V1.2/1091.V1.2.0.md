# OceanBase Deployer V1.2.0

## Version information

* Release date: December 31, 2021

* Version: V1.2.0

## Overview

* This version provides the `obd mirror disable` and `obd mirror enable` commands for you to disable or enable a remote mirror repository. For more information, see **obd mirror disable** and **obd mirror enable** in [Mirror and repository commands](../../300.obd-command/200.command-group-for-mirroring-and-warehousing.md).

* This version provides the `--wp/--with-parameter` option for you to load parameters when you restart an OceanBase cluster by running the `obd cluster restart` command. By default, the command is executed without loading parameters.

* This version supports cross-version upgrades and rotating upgrades of OceanBase Database.

* This version supports the deployment of OceanBase Agent (OBAgent) V1.1.0.

* The parameter validity is checked during editing and deployment. Invalid parameter modifications are not allowed.

* This version optimizes the lock granularity, so that you can run multiple OBD commands at the same time in most cases.

## Bug fixes

Fixed an issue that when you perform a Sysbench test on an OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP) node, the root user cannot be connected.
