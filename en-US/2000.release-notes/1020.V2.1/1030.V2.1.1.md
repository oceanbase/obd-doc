* Version: V2.1.1

## Overview

## Bug fixes

* Fixed an issue that an exception occurred during the remote repository connectivity check in some cases.

* Fixed an issue that an exception occurred during the upgrade if `root_password` contains certain special characters.

* Fixed an issue that an exception occurred during the command execution if the current path does not exist.

* Fixed an issue where, when specifying the `-s` option in the `obd cluster start` command to start only a few OBServer nodes, OceanBase Deployer (OBD) checked the availability of all OBServer nodes.

* Fixed an issue where the Prometheus service was being started again on OBServer nodes where the Prometheus service was already running.

* Fixed an issue that the result of specification calculation did not meet expectations when only configuring the `system_memory` parameter.

* Fixed an issue where the edition selection did not meet expectations when running the `obd web` command if both the OceanBase Database Enterprise Edition and Community Edition installation packages were present.
